# Case Study #1: Danny's Diner

The 8 Week SQL Challenge is an initiative started by Danny Ma, who runs a website called "8weeksqlchallenge.com". Here, you can access case studies related to SQL practice, and solve real-life problems to develop a deeper understanding of SQL.

This is my solution to Case Study #1, which is titled Danny's Diner.

## Problem Statement:

Danny wants to use data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, particularly regarding their visiting patterns, expenditure, and favourite menu items. Gaining a better understanding of his customers will enable him to provide a more personalised experience for his loyal patrons.

He intends to use these insights to help him decide whether to expand his existing customer loyalty program. For this case study, Danny has provided three key datasets:

Sales
Menu
Members
